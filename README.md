## [Regression Project: New York City Taxi Fare Prediction](https://github.com/estevaovukelic/Regressions/blob/main/New_York_City_Taxi_Fare_Prediction.ipynb)

- File descriptions train.csv - Input features and target fare_amount values for the training set (about 55M rows). test.csv - Input features for the test set    (about 10K rows). Your goal is to predict fare_amount for each row. 

- Predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations.
- Estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an **RMSE** of $5-$8.
- Engineering features.
- Training with: Linear Regression,Ridge, Lasso, Nearest Neighbors,Decision Tree, Random Forest,Gradient Boosting, XGBoost and Deep Learning.
- Best and fast model: XGBoost.
- Submission in Kaggle: **RMSE** 3.71675


## [Binary Classification Project: Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/estevaovukelic/Binary_classification-/blob/main/Analysing_Employee_Attrition.ipynb)

 Factors that lead to employee attrition are explored such as: distance from home to work and job loss, average monthly income from schooling, and job loss. This is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists.
 
- Exploration and processing of data.
- Data analysis and preprocessing.
- Converting categorical variables to dummy variables.
- Concatenating dataframes.
- Using Smote to Balance Class.
- Training with: Logistic Regression,Ridge, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random forest and S V C.


## [Cluster Project: Customer_Segmentation_I](https://github.com/estevaovukelic/Clusters/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation_I.ipynb)

We will identify, study, analyze, treat and group the data in order to apply the best marketing strategy that each group requires.

- We will use pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib and grouping with KMeans and PCA.
- Exploration and processing of data.
- Data analysis and preprocessing.
- Elbow Method.
- Grouping,
- Concatenating dataframes.
- Visualization of Clusters using PCA to transform data to 2 dimensions
