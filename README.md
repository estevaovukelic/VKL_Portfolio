Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/overview.

- File descriptions train.csv - Input features and target fare_amount values for the training set (about 55M rows). test.csv - Input features for the test set    (about 10K rows). Your goal is to predict fare_amount for each row. 


- Predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations.
- Estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an *RMSE* of $5-$8
