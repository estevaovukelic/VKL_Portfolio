## [Regression Project: New York City Taxi Fare Prediction](https://github.com/estevaovukelic/Regressions/blob/main/New_York_City_Taxi_Fare_Prediction.ipynb)
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/overview.

Description:

In this playground competition, hosted in partnership with Google Cloud and Coursera, you are tasked with predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations. While you can get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an RMSE of $5-$8, depending on the model used (see the starter code for an example of this approach in Kernels). Your challenge is to do better than this using Machine Learning techniques!

File descriptions train.csv - Input features and target fare_amount values for the training set (about 55M rows). test.csv - Input features for the test set (about 10K rows). Your goal is to predict fare_amount for each row. sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format (columns key and fare_amount). This file 'predicts' fare_amount to be $11.35 for all rows, which is the mean fare_amount from the training set.
