## [Regression Project: New York City Taxi Fare Prediction](https://github.com/estevaovukelic/Regressions/blob/main/New_York_City_Taxi_Fare_Prediction.ipynb)

- File descriptions train.csv - Input features and target fare_amount values for the training set (about 55M rows). test.csv - Input features for the test set    (about 10K rows). Your goal is to predict fare_amount for each row. 

- Predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations.
- Estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an **RMSE** of $5-$8.
- Engineering features.
- Training with: Linear Regression,Ridge, Lasso, Nearest Neighbors,Decision Tree, Random Forest,Gradient Boosting, XGBoost and Deep Learning.
- Best and fast model: XGBoost.
- Submission in Kaggle: **RMSE** 3.71675
## [Regression Project:  Rossmann Store Sales](https://github.com/estevaovukelic/Regressions/blob/main/RossmannStoreSales.ipynb)

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

## [Binary Classification Project: Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/estevaovukelic/Binary_classification-/blob/main/Analysing_Employee_Attrition.ipynb)

 Factors that lead to employee attrition are explored such as: distance from home to work and job loss, average monthly income from schooling, and job loss. This is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists.
 
- Exploration and processing of data.
- Data analysis and preprocessing.
- Converting categorical variables to dummy variables.
- Concatenating dataframes.
- Using Smote to Balance Class.
- Training with: Logistic Regression,Ridge, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random forest and S V C.


## [Cluster Project: Customer_Segmentation_I](https://github.com/estevaovukelic/Clusters/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation_I.ipynb)

We will identify, study, analyze, treat and group the data in order to apply the best marketing strategy that each group requires.

- We will use pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib and grouping with KMeans and PCA.
- Exploration and processing of data.
- Data analysis and preprocessing.
- Elbow Method.
- Grouping,
- Concatenating dataframes.
- Visualization of Clusters using PCA to transform data to 2 dimensions
